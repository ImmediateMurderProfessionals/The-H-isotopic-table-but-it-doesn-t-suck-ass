# The-H-isotopic-table-but-it-doesn-t-suck-ass
In this repository is an .sb3 file. To view the isotopic table, download the file, go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor, and hit "File" and then "Load from your computer". Select the .sb3 file and then the isotopic table should be viewable.

This is unfinished; I only made the isotopes up to Tescratium (element 45), but I did make the entire beta-stability line
It will be posted to Scratch on my account when I get unbanned from both Scratch and HTS on March 31, 2025.
